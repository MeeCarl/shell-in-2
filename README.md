# Shell~In {2.0}

## The new release of Shell~In, introducing new commands like ` print.file `  and ` define.notify `, and removing the old useless command `udl.placement`.

## Shell~In {1.0} had many missing features, such as ` clear ` command and some bugs like ` udl.placement ` which did not work.

## So in the new and refreshing Shell~In {2.0}, we have upgraded the shell to have many new commands, and no bugs.
